</div><p><span class="uppercase">ow</span> delicious it is
when one is young
to wake up in a
fresh place on a
summer’s morning.
It was my belief
that the birds woke
me, there was such a
twittering under the
eaves where the house-martins
had built their
nests, such a warbling
of thrushes breakfasting
on the dewy
lawn, such a cawing of
rooks under the elm trees; such a
joyous bird-symphony altogether, while
I lay in my old-fashioned blue bed,
looking round the quaint old room and
trying to decipher the meaning of the
curious prints in their black frames.
When I was tired of this I rose and
went to the window. The kitchen
garden, with its row of beehives, was
just under the window, and beyond were
Cherrytree-lane and Squire Hawtry’s
cornfield, and then a vague blue line,
and a brown sail shimmering in the sunlight.
The sweet peacefulness of the
scene seemed to sink into my heart,
and I could have sung my <i>Te Deum</i>
with the birds.</p>

<p>When the children were dressed and
we had finished our early breakfast, I
went to the window with Reggie while
Hannah was clearing the table. Joyce
had already climbed up on the window
seat; she was wild to go into the
garden and see auntie’s pets, and I
thought it would be no harm to humour
her fancy and defer our walk to the
shore.</p>

<p>As we stood there Miss Cheriton came
out on the terrace. She wore a broad
brimmed hat, and long gardening
gloves, and carried a basket. She gave
a low, peculiar call, and in a moment
there was a fluttering of wings in the air,
and a crowd of pigeons came round her
feet to pick up the grain she had
scattered; the pheasants and peacocks
joined them.</p>

<p>I thought what a pretty picture it
would have made; the old red brick
house with its ivy-covered gables in the
background; the terrace with its sundial
and antique vases; the girl in her white
gown with her beautiful pets round her,
her favourite blue pigeons eating out of
her hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, auntie, may we come?” pleaded
Joyce; and Miss Cheriton looked up at
us and smiled and nodded, and Joyce
snatched her sun-bonnet and in a few
minutes we had joined her on the
terrace.</p>

<p>She greeted us with evident pleasure,
and playfully held up her finger to
silence Joyce.</p>

<p>“Don’t make a noise, my pet,
or Rolf will hear you and want to come
out; he is having his breakfast with
Aunt Adelaide; and he is so rough and
tiresome that I do not care to have him
with me just now; you shall go with me
into the poultry yard and feed the little
yellow chicks yourself.”</p>

<p>Joyce was highly delighted at this
prospect, and trotted along in her big
white sun-bonnet, chattering as fast as
her tongue would go. When we arrived
at the poultry yard, Miss Cheriton filled
her pinafore with grain and showed her
where to throw it, and then picked up
one of the downy yellow chicks for
Reggie to kiss and hug; but he was so
unwilling to part with it that we had
some trouble to rescue the warm struggling
thing; only the speckled hen was
in such a fuss, clacking loudly in the
midst of her brood. When we had exhausted
the grain and had fed some
grey rabbits, and had peeped in at the
stables, and had bestowed a passing
attention on the big St. Bernard in his
kennel—Miss Cheriton’s chief favourite
next to her brown mare, Bonnie—we sat
down on a bench in the orchard, at some
little distance from the beehives, while
the children gathered daisies and buttercups.</p>

<p>“I am so fond of this old orchard,”
observed Miss Cheriton, as she threw
down her empty basket and removed
her gloves, showing a pair of small
brown hands that looked very strong
and capable; “when I have nothing
else to do, I and my pets come here and
enjoy the quiet. Do you know, the peacocks
and pheasants will follow me all
over the place as closely as a dog? They
don’t mind Lion a bit; and he is as
gentle as a lamb. On Sunday afternoon
I have all the creatures round me.
Adelaide declares I waste my time
dreadfully with the beasties.”</p>

<p>“They must give you plenty of occupation,
Miss Cheriton,” for I have
come to the conclusion that this girl
was far from idle. The care of that extensive
poultry-yard could be no sinecure’s
office, besides which the beehives
were her exclusive charge, though
I heard afterwards the gardener’s son,
Jim, was her under helper. All the live
things about the place looked to her
for food and comfort. She had a cage
full of canaries in the conservatory, and
a large grey parrot as well.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am always with my pets and
flowers until luncheon-time,” she remarked,
carelessly; “Jim is a very
handy boy, and helps me with the rough
work. I was up at six this morning, and
we had moved half the pots in the conservatory
before breakfast. I am always
up early, except in the winter; the
world is not half awake at that time of
the year, and certainly not well lighted.”</p>

<p>“Those beehives must be a very profitable
investment,” I observed, for I
had heard before now that people had
added largely to their incomes by keeping
bees.</p>

<p>“You would be surprised how much
I make by my hives,” she returned. “I
have only a limited interest in the poultry
yard, and have to find chickens and
eggs for the household, but the beehives
are my own. I succeeded so well with
them last year, and I believe I shall do
just as well this autumn. I am very
proud of my bees.”</p>

<p>“It would not be a bad plan——” I
began, and then I stopped, for I had
spoken hastily, and how could I know
if my words would be well received?</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, with a pretty air
of impatience, “why do you stop? You
have got something dreadfully sensible
in your head, and I should like to hear
it.”</p>

<p>“I am rather too quick with my
words,” I answered, somewhat hesitating.
“I was only thinking of what
you said last night; you were condemning
yourself very needlessly, as I think,
and comparing your means of usefulness
with Mrs. Morton’s.”</p>

<p>“With Violet’s many-sided duties.
Well, I do not retract my words. I said
I was always amusing myself; so I am;
my bees are my playthings.”</p>

<p>“You could make them work for you
if you chose,” I returned, quickly; “if
one of these hives, for example, were
devoted to some good purpose, if the
money you got for the honey were given
to one of those institutions in which your
sister takes such interest.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what a nice idea,” she exclaimed,
with a bright look. “I wonder
what put that into your head. I was
rather uncomfortable having all that
money to spend on myself; I thought of
giving some to Adelaide for Rolf, only
I cannot get up an interest in that boy.
I have more than I want, for one does
not need so many dresses in the country,
and nothing will induce me to go through
a London season again. I tried it once,”
with a merry laugh, “just to please
Violet, but it nearly killed me, so I
wrote to father to take me away. I
should have liked the balls very well,
only I got so dreadfully sleepy before
they were over, and the rides in the
Row were nice, if only they would have
let me gallop, but I was nearly taken up
for furious riding once when I could not
get Bonnie to stop, and after that Alick
lectured me, and I got sick of it.”</p>

<p>“You would not like your sister’s life,
then?”</p>

<p>Gay shrugged her shoulders with a
gesture of disgust.</p>

<p>“It is not life at all; it is a daily
round of harassing duties. Look what
it has done for Violet—robbed her of
spirits and bloom; she will be an old
woman before her time. The fun is
very well, but there is too much of it.
I pined for fresh air, for the garden, and
the bees, and my other pets. I am
afraid my partners thought me dreadfully
rustic; I seemed to amuse them. I
do not care for the young men in ball-rooms,
they are so vapid, and, for all
their politeness, they seemed to be laughing
at one.”</p>

<p>I could not help smiling at this; it
was very odd she should be so frank with
me. She must have forgotten that I had
no experience of ball-rooms, and had
never danced except at school-parties,
when the girls were allowed to bring
their brothers.</p>

<p>“You are looking satirical, Miss Fenton.
Oh, of course, I see what you
mean; but never mind, there are better
things than balls in life. For my part,
I prefer a solitary gallop on Bonnie to
Strauss’s best waltz, though I do love
dancing too, but, you see, neither Violet
nor I have been trained to a fashionable
life. We have lived in the country, have
risen early, and been in the open air
from morning to night, and now poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">{227}</span>
Violet never goes to bed in time to get
a beauty sleep, and she drives instead
of taking a good walk, so no wonder her
cheeks get pale and thin.”</p>

<p>“It is a grievous pity,” I began, but
Gay interrupted me.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is no use talking about Violet,
I have given her up long ago; Alick has
robbed me of her entirely. Now about
your benevolent project; I mean to carry
it out. Do you know the Children’s Incurable
Hospital, Maida Vale? Violet
is always working for that. There is to
be a ‘Muriel Cot,’ in memory of the
dear little baby she lost. Now why
should I not have a ‘Children’s Hive,’
and make those special bees gather
honey for those little incurable children.
I call that a lovely idea. Look, that
end hive under the apple tree shall be
the one. Miss Fenton, you have emancipated
me; I feel a philanthropist
already; the world will be the better for
me and my workers.”</p>

<p>I looked at her admiringly; such a
lovely colour had come to her face, and her
eyes looked so bright and happy. I felt
I understood Gay Cheriton from that
moment. She was one of those guileless,
innocent natures that are long in throwing
off childhood. She was full of generous
impulses, frank and outspoken to a
fault; the yoke of life pressed lightly on
her; she was like an unbridled colt, that
had never felt the curb or the spur;
gentle guidance, a word from those she
loved, was sufficient to restrain her. I
knew now why Joyce had called her the
little auntie; there was an air of extreme
youth about her; she was so very lovable
that diminutiveness suited her, and
I thought her father’s pet name of humming
bird suited her exactly; she was so
quick and bright and restless, her vitality
and energy demanded constant movement.</p>

<p>“How I am chattering!” she said at
last, “and I have all the vases to fill
before luncheon, but, as I told you last
night, I am fond of talking if I can
get anyone to listen to me. Adelaide
never will listen to me patiently; she
says I am such a chatterbox. Goodbye
for the present, Miss Fenton.” And
she tripped away, singing in such a
fresh young voice as she went down the
orchard that I did not wonder when a
little brown linnet perched on a rose-bush
answered her. I think the birds
must have loved to hear her.</p>

<p>I sat for some time contemplating the
low white gate and the row of beehives.
I was rather pleased with the idea I had
started; a word in season sometimes
brings a rich harvest. I thought some
time of the tiny workers in their brown
livery bringing in their rich stores for
the afflicted children; and it seemed to
me that the offering would be a sweet
savour to the Master who loved
children.</p>

<p>I fell into a reverie over it; I thought
how much might be done for others
with little cost if people would only
think; it is want of thought that clogs
usefulness. Great sacrifices are so
seldom demanded from us; we are not
now called upon to forsake all that we
hold dear and follow the Christ—little
daily duties, small hourly renunciations,
pleasures given up for some cheerful
loving service: these are the free-will
offerings that all may yield, only the
people must “give willingly.”</p>

<p>The morning passed pleasantly in the
sunny orchard; when the children tired
of their play we went back to the house
that they might have their noonday
sleep. I was sitting alone in the
nursery, mending Reggie’s pinafore,
when I heard the clatter of noisy footsteps
in the corridor, and a moment
after the nursery latch was lifted without
ceremony, and Rolf peeped in. He had
a droll, half-ashamed expression on his
face, but it bore no trace of yesterday’s
ill-humour.</p>

<p>“May I come in, if you please, Mrs.
New Nurse?”</p>

<p>“My name is Miss Fenton, as I told
you yesterday; or, you may call me
Nurse if you choose. Yes; you may
come in and talk to me if you like,
Master Rolf; but you must be very quiet,
as your little cousins are asleep.”</p>

<p>“What precious babies they must be
to sleep in the day!” he observed, disdainfully,
as he planted himself without
ceremony on the window seat. “I sit
up until ten o’clock every night; sometimes
I will not go to bed until mother
goes.”</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise,’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Master Rolf.”</p>

<p>“Wealthy means rich, doesn’t it?
Well, Juddy said I shall be a rich man
some day. I have got father’s watch
and sword now, only mother locks them
up until I am bigger. You are not rich,
eh, Miss Fenton?” peeping into my
face rather maliciously.</p>

<p>“No, Master Rolf,” I returned, quietly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I knew that you are only a
nurse; I heard mother and Aunt Gay
talking about you last night. Mother
said you were a poor sort, and she wondered
at Violet’s infatuation. She
thought you stuck up and disagreeable,
and not much to look at; a plain young
woman, and very disrespectful. There,
now!”</p>

<p>“Master Rolf,” I observed, calmly,
and suppressing my inward wrath, “you
call yourself a gentleman, but I assure
you a savage shows more gentlemanly
feeling than you. Don’t you know your
mother’s words should be sacred, and
you are bound in honour not to repeat
them?” And then, as he seemed rather
impressed at this, I told him how, even
among savages and wild and uncultured
nations, the sense of hospitality and
gratitude was so strong that, when a
man had partaken of bread and salt,
broken the bread of fellowship, he was
bound in honour not to betray or injure
his host in any way; and I related to
him an anecdote of an Armenian servant,
who had long been faithful to his
master, and had defended him in many
dangers in his travels through a lawless
country.</p>

<p>“The master,” I continued, “had
vast treasures under his care, and he
was greatly troubled when his servant
said he must leave him. Judge what
his feelings must have been when the
man coolly told him that he had entered
into a league with some banditti to rob
him of his money; that it would be
mean to remain in his service under
these circumstances, and that he had
given him warning of his intention, that
he might defend himself, and that now
they were equal.</p>

<p>“Even this lawless robber had some
notions of honour, Master Rolf; while
he ate his master’s bread and salt he
was bound by his service not to injure
him. Now you are only a little boy,
but you ought to understand that you
also are bound not to betray your mother
or repeat her words, as long as you eat
her bread and salt; that is the way
people do so much mischief in the world,
repeating things they know are not
meant to be heard.”</p>

<p>Rolf’s eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>“I like that story awfully. Yes,”
and looking at me critically, “I like
you too, though you are a plain young
woman. No, I did not mean to say
that,” interrupting himself in a hurry;
“bread and salt, you know; I shall
always think of that when I am going
to tell Juddy things that mother says.
She is an old stupid, you know, and she
never has time to make a tail to my
kite, and mother says she has no patience
with her, she is such an——Oh,
oh, Miss Fenton, bread and salt! How
ever shall I remember when I want to
put Juddy in a rage?”</p>

<p>“I daresay I shall be able to help
you with your kite,” I returned, changing
the subject, “but we shall want
plenty of string and paper.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you nice old thing,” replied
Rolf, ecstatically. “You are not a bit
plain, not a bit; I shall tell mother I
think you lovely, and that I mean to
marry you when I grow up. Won’t she
stare at that? May I bring my kite
here this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“No, no, my dear, not this afternoon;
we are going to the shore.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then I will come with you.
Mother,” as Mrs. Markham appeared
at the door, and looked at us with unfeigned
surprise, “I can’t drive with
you this afternoon; I am going on the
beach with Miss Fenton and the children.”</p>

articles
we propose
to treat of
home life in
bygone days.</p>

<p>That being
the case, our
net will be
spread wide
enough to
catch a very
miscellaneous
collection
of facts.
Nothing will
come amiss
to us that in
any way illustrates
the domestic
existence
of our
ancestors, and every reader, whatever her turn
of mind, will be sure to find something worth
taking note of.</p>

<p>It will be a different sort of narrative from
the history of great men, or a tale of battles,
sieges, and such-like imposing circumstances.
We shall speak of houses and furniture, food
and clothing, etiquette and good manners,
wages and prices, education and superstition,
household industries and household amusements,
old recipes and domestic medicines,
the ways of the poor and the ways of the rich.
We shall make as much of needles and pins as
ordinary history-books do of swords and guns,
and a girl singing an old song will have more
attention than they give to an ambassador
negotiating a foreign treaty.</p>

<p>The worst of it is that the subject is long,
whilst our space is of necessity short. We shall
try, however, to change that disadvantage into
an advantage, by giving only those facts that
appear most interesting. There is a pleasure,
too, when reading about a subject, to know
that the half has not been told, and that to
all who care to pursue it on their own account
a rich harvest remains yet unreaped.</p>

<p>We are not going to begin with the time
“when wild in woods the noble savage ran,”
and homes were in caves and under the shade
of green trees; our starting-point is to be the
reign of Henry VIII., and our first article will
embrace that reign and the reigns of Edward
VI. and Queen Mary—in other words,
from 1509 to 1558.</p>

<p>In those far-back days many things were
different from what they are now. There has
been a great advance in material comfort. Our
forefathers, no doubt, had just as much wit
and wisdom as we have; but we can boast an
advantage over them in possessing more of
the conveniences of life. In that respect, at
least, we are lucky to have been born so late.</p>

<p>Let us not imagine, however, that they had
a bad time of it, or were discontented or
miserable because they had not everything
just like us. People do not sigh after what
they have never either seen or heard of. We
really find happiness in our affections—not
in our material surroundings, which are of
secondary importance; and it is not unreasonable
to conclude that, as human nature is always
the same, these ancestors of ours enjoyed
life in their way quite as much as we do.</p>

<p>We start with the subject of houses and
furniture. When Henry VIII. began to reign,
well-to-do people in towns lived, as a rule, in
houses built principally of timber, the fronts
being often ornamented with rich carvings of
fanciful and grotesque objects. The upper
storeys projected; so much so, indeed, that in
a street people in the attics on either side
could almost shake hands. There was a reason
for building in this way. As the houses were
of perishable material, each storey gave protection
from the weather to the storey beneath
it.</p>

<p>Such a quantity of timber being used, there
was a great danger of fire, and the warning of
the bellmen who proclaimed the hours of the
night in London was certainly needed, when,
to their instructions to “be charitable to the
poor, and pray for the dead,” they added,
“Take care of your fire and candle.”</p>

<p>The labouring people in the country lived
in houses constructed of the first things that
came to hand—often nothing but wattle and
mud or clay. When the mud or clay cracked,
under the influence of summer’s heat or
winter’s frost, it was a simple matter with the
same material to “stop a hole to keep the
wind away.” Ventilation was very defective,
and Erasmus attributes the frequent sicknesses
with which England was then visited in a great
measure to the want of fresh air in the dwelling-houses.</p>

<p>The ideas that regulated the furnishing and
decoration of the houses of the upper classes
form a marked contrast to those prevailing
nowadays. The furniture was more
massive, and there was less of it. The bedchamber
of Henry VIII. contained only a
couple of joint cupboards, a joint stool,
two hand-irons, a fire-fork, a pair of tongs, a
fire-pan, and a steel mirror covered with
yellow velvet.</p>

<p>Carpets came into use before the reign of
Henry VIII. was far advanced, though in the
reign of Queen Mary rushes still strewed the
floor of the presence-chamber. Feather beds
were used in Henry VIII.’s reign by the upper
classes. When they went travelling, they
were no longer content with the floor or a
hard bench at halting-places, but generally
carried portable beds (packed in leather cases)
with them on horseback. In the lower ranks
of life straw pallets, or rough mats with a
round log for a pillow, formed the ordinary
provision for sleeping.</p>

<p>Ladies’ dresses amongst the nobility in
Henry VIII.’s reign had a certain formality,
but in many points were elegant and becoming.
Early in the sixteenth century they
were made low and cut square about the neck:
the sleeves were tight at the shoulder, but
suddenly became very large and open, showing
the puffed sleeves of the under-dress. The long
skirts were worn open in front to the waist,
showing the kirtle or petticoat. Sometimes,
however, dresses were worn high, with short
waists and a small falling collar.</p>

<p>At a little later date the sleeves of dresses
were puffed at the shoulders, and when the
dress was made open above the girdle, what
was called a “partlet”—a kind of habit-shirt—was
worn beneath it, and carried up to the
throat.</p>

<p>Sleeves were one of the strong points of the
ladies of those times. They were independent
articles of clothing, and were attached at
pleasure to the rest of the costume. “Much
splendour,” says Mr. J. R. Planché, “was
lavished on this part of the dress, and its
various fashions were singularly quaint and
elegant.” Amongst the inventories of Henry
VIII.’s reign we find “three pair of purple
satin sleeves for women; one pair of linen
sleeves, paned with gold over the arm, quilted
with black silk, and wrought with flowers
between the panes and at the hands; one
pair of sleeves of purple gold tissue damask
wire, each sleeve tied with aglets of gold;
one pair of crimson satin sleeves, four buttons
of gold being set on each sleeve, and in every
button nine pearls.”</p>

<p>Necklaces and other ornaments of jewellery
were much worn. No dress was complete
without a girdle, and from the girdle was
suspended by means of chains such articles as
tablets, knives and purses. Sometimes, in
place of the chains, the girdles themselves had
a long pendant, which was elaborately
decorated.</p>

<p>We get a glimpse of the style of dress
amongst commoner folk, in the history of a
famous clothier known as “Jack of Newbury.”
When Jack was married, the bride, in her
wedding costume, must have cut quite a
picturesque figure. “The bride,” we read,
“being dressed in a gown of sheep’s russet
and a kirtle of fine worsted, her head attired
in a <i>billiment</i> (habiliment) of gold, and her
hair, as yellow as gold, hanging down behind
her, which was curiously combed and plaited,
according to the manner of those days, was
led to church by two boys with bride laces,
and rosemary tied about their silken sleeves.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Jack became a widow, and after she
had laid aside her weeds she is described as
coming one day out of the kitchen “in a fair
train gown stuck full of silver pins, having a
white cap on her head, with cuts of curious
needlework under the same, and an apron
before her as white as driven snow.”</p>

<p>The ordinary costume for men of the upper
ranks in the time of Henry VIII. was a full-skirted
jacket or doublet, with large sleeves to
the wrists, over which was hung a short cloak
or coat, with loose hanging sleeves and a
broad, rolling collar of fur. To these articles
of dress was added a brimmed cap, jewelled
and bordered with ostrich feathers; stockings
and square-toed shoes.</p>

<p>A sumptuary law was passed in 1533,
limiting the use of certain expensive stuffs and
valuable personal ornaments to certain
classes. Common people and serving men, for
example, were confined to the use of cloth of a
fixed price, and lamb’s fur only, and they were
forbidden to wear any ornaments or even
buttons of gold, silver, or gilt work, excepting
the badge of their lord or master.</p>

<p>The apprentices of London wore blue
cloaks in summer, and in winter gowns of the
same colour. Blue cloaks or gowns were a
mark of servitude.</p>

<p>Fourteen years before the beginning of
Henry VIII.’s reign wages were settled by
Act of Parliament. A free mason, master
carpenter, rough mason, bricklayer, master
tiler, plumber, glazier, carver or joiner, was
allowed from Easter to Michaelmas to take
6d. a day, without meat or drink. Suppose
he had meat and drink, he could only
charge 4d. A master having under him six
men was allowed a penny a day extra. From<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">{229}</span>
Michaelmas to Easter a penny a day was
taken off these prices. Wages, however,
gradually rose all through the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>In 1511, in the household of the Earl of
Northumberland, the principal priest of the
chapel had £5 a year; a chaplain graduate
£3 6s. 8d.; a chaplain not a graduate, £2;
a minstrel, £4; a serving boy, 13s. 4d. These
payments were over and above food and
lodging.</p>

<p>When wages and salaries were so low, compared
with those of our own day, we must
expect to find a corresponding difference in
prices. In 1541 a hundred eggs sold for
1s. 2d., a dozen pigeons cost 10d., a good fat
goose cost 8d., and you could buy a fat sheep
for from 2s. 4d. to 4s., and an ox for about £2.
In 1533 an Act was passed by which the price
of beef and pork was fixed at ½d. a pound,
and veal at ¾d.</p>

<p>Of the state of learning, in the houses at any
rate of the upper classes, much is to be said
that reflects credit on our ancestors. The
royal court of Henry VIII., whatever might be
its faults, did not neglect study. In the case
of Prince Edward, afterwards Edward VI.,
devotion to his books no doubt had an injurious
effect on his health, and there is no saying
what might have been the result to England
had he had less learning and more exercise.
Bishop Burnet tells us that he was so forward
in his education that “before he was eight
years old he wrote Latin letters to his father,
who was a prince of that stern severity that
one can hardly think that those about his
son durst cheat him by making letters for
him.”</p>

<p>Mary had a good knowledge of classic
authors, and wrote good Latin letters. Elizabeth
began every day with an hour’s reading
in the Greek Testament, the tragedies of
Sophocles, and the orations of Isocrates and
Demosthenes. She also was a good Latin
scholar, spoke French and Italian as fluently
as English, had a smattering of Dutch and
German, and was a devourer of works on
history.</p>

<p>These two princesses were the highest in
station of the accomplished women of the time,
but there were many who equalled, and some
who surpassed, them in learning. The most
remarkable of all for accomplishments was
certainly Lady Jane Grey, afterwards the
unfortunate queen of a ten-days’ reign. Lady
Jane took so kindly to study that she became
the marvel of the age for her acquirements.
She excelled in needlework and in music, and,
aided by her tutor, Dr. Elmer, or Aylmer,
afterwards Bishop of London, had thoroughly
mastered Latin, Greek, French, and Italian,
and knew something of at least three Oriental
tongues—Hebrew, Chaldee, and Arabic.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting passages—and
a touching one it is, too—in the writings of
Roger Ascham is that in “The Schoolmaster,”
in which he describes a visit he paid to the
home of Lady Jane’s parents in Leicestershire
in 1550. She was then little over thirteen
years old. It gives us a glimpse of the girl-life
of the period in a high rank of society,
and deserves to be quoted in full.</p>

<p>“Before I went into Germany,” says Ascham,
“I came to Broadgate, in Leicestershire, to
take my leave of that noble Lady Jane Grey, to
whom I was exceeding much beholden. Her
parents, the Duke and Duchess, with all the
household, gentlemen and gentlewomen, were
hunting in the park. I found her in her
chamber, reading Phædon Platonis, in Greek,
and that with as much delight as some gentlemen
would read a merry tale in Boccaccio.</p>

<p>“After salutation and duty done with some
other talk, I asked her why she would leave
such pastime in the park?</p>

<p>“Smiling, she answered me, ‘I wis all their
sport in the park is but a shadow to that
pleasure that I find in Plato. Alas, good
folk! they never felt what true pleasure
meant.’</p>

<p>“‘And how came you, madam,’ quoth I,
‘to this deep knowledge of pleasure, and what
did chiefly allure you unto it, seeing not many
women but very few men have attained thereunto?’</p>

<p>“‘I will tell you,’ quoth she, ‘and tell you
a truth which perchance you will marvel at.
One of the greatest benefits that God ever
gave me is that He sent me so sharp and
severe parents, and so gentle a schoolmaster.
For when I am in presence either of father or
mother, whether I speak, keep silence, sit,
stand or go, eat, drink, be merry or sad, be
sewing, playing, dancing, or doing anything
else, I must do it as it were in such weight,
measure, and number—even so perfectly as
God made the world—or else I am so sharply
taunted, so cruelly threatened, yea, presently,
sometimes, with pinches, nips, and bobs, and
other ways which I will not name for the
honour I bear them; so without measure misordered
that I think myself in hell, till time
come that I must go to Mr. Elmer, who
teacheth me so gently, so pleasantly, with
such fair allurements to learning, that I think
all the time nothing whiles I am with him.
And when I am called from him I fall on
weeping, because whatsoever I do else but
learning is full of grief, trouble, fear, and
whole misliking unto me. And thus my book
hath been so much my pleasure, and bringeth
daily to me more pleasure and more, that in
respect of it all other pleasures in very deed
be but trifles and troubles unto me.’</p>

<p>“I remember this talk gladly,” Ascham
adds, “both because it is so worthy of
memory, and because, also, it was the last talk
that ever I had and the last time that ever I
saw that noble and worthy lady.”</p>

<p>However learning might flourish in the
upper circles of society, it seems to have
languished in the schools and among the
people. But efforts were made in the direction
of popular education, and more grammar
schools it is said were founded in the latter
part of Henry VIII.’s reign than in the three
hundred years preceding.</p>

<p>Music was practised by all classes. Erasmus,
who saw much of England in the beginning
of the sixteenth century, speaks of the English
as the most accomplished in the skill of
music of any people. “It is certain,” says
Mr. Chappell, “that the beginning of the
sixteenth century produced in England a race
of musicians equal to the best in foreign
countries, and in point of secular music
decidedly in advance of them.”</p>

<p>Henry VIII. was a great patron of music,
and, more than that, he was himself a composer
and performer. He played well on both
the virginals and the lute, and could sing at
sight. But to sing at sight was a common
accomplishment amongst gentlemen; so common,
indeed, that inability to do so was looked
on as a serious drawback to success in life.
Homes were rendered cheerful by the singing
of madrigals and other part music. The first
collection of songs in parts that was printed
in England belongs to the year 1530.</p>

<p>Besides music, many other recreations were
indulged in. These were the days of archery,
casting of the bar, wrestling, and such martial
sports as fighting with swords and battle-axes.
For rural pastimes there were hunting and
hawking—and in these the ladies were often
as enthusiastic as the gentlemen. Card-playing
was highly popular, and in the reign of
Henry VIII. a prohibitory statute was found
necessary to prevent apprentices from using
cards, except in the Christmas holidays, and
then only in their masters’ houses. The same
statute forbade any householder to permit
card-playing in his house, under the penalty of
six shillings and eightpence for every offence.</p>

<p>May Day was a general holiday, and Maypoles
were set up in every town and village.
The observance of May Day differed no doubt
in minor particulars in different places, but in
general it consisted in people of all ranks
going out early in the morning into the
“sweet meadows and green woods,” where
they broke down branches from the trees, and
adorned them with nosegays and crowns of
flowers. “This done, they returned homewards
with their booty, and made their doors and
windows triumph in the flowery spoil.” The
Maypole was set up, and the rest of the day
was spent in dancing round it, and in sports of
different kinds. When evening came, bonfires
were lighted in the streets. Even the reigning
sovereign joined in these amusements. On
May Day, 1515, Henry VIII. and Queen
Katherine, his wife, rode a-Maying from
Greenwich to the high ground of Shooter’s-hill,
accompanied by many lords and ladies.</p>

<p>There was a famous London Maypole in
Cornhill before the parish church of St. Andrew,
which thus got the name of St. Andrew
Undershaft. The pole or shaft, Stow tells
us, was set up by the citizens “every year,
on May Day, in the morning, in the midst of
the street, before the south door of the said
church; which shaft, when it was set on end
and fixed in the ground, was higher than the
church steeple.” When its annual day of usefulness
was over, the pole was taken down
again and hung on iron hooks above the doors
of the neighbouring houses.</p>

<p>This pole was destroyed in 1550, the fourth
year of Edward VI.’s reign, in an outburst of
Puritanism, after a sermon preached at St.
Paul’s Cross against May games. The inhabitants
of the houses against whose wall the
pole had found shelter sawed it in pieces, and
every man took a bit and made use of it to
light his fire.</p>

<p>Mingled with the festivities of May Day there
was a distinct set of sports, very popular in
the early part of the sixteenth century, intended
to represent the adventures of the
renowned woodland hero, Robin Hood. The
enthusiasm with which the common people
entered into these sports may be seen from
the reception Bishop Latimer met with when
he once proposed to preach in a town on the
1st of May. He tells the incident himself in
a sermon he preached in 1549 before Edward
VI.</p>

<p>“I came once myself,” he says, “to a
place, riding on a journey homeward from
London, and I sent word overnight into
the town that I would preach there in the
morning because it was holy day, and methought
it was an holy day’s work.” (It was
the Feast of the Apostles Philip and James.)
“The church stood in my way, and I took my
horse and my company and went thither. I
thought I should have found a great company
in the church, and when I came there the
church door was fast locked.</p>

<p>“I tarried there half an hour and more.
At last the key was found, and one of the
parish comes to me and says, ‘Sir, this is a
busy day with us. We cannot hear you. It
is Robin Hood’s Day. The parish are gone
abroad to gather for Robin Hood. I pray you
forbid them not.’</p>

<p>“I was fain there to give place to Robin
Hood. I thought my rochet”—or bishop’s
surplice—“should have been regarded, though
I were not; but it would not serve; it was
fain to give place to Robin Hood.”</p>

<p>How did stay-at-home people amuse themselves
then in the long winter evenings?
No doubt they either made time seem short by
going to sleep, or they sat by the fireside
singing songs or telling oft-told stories, or
exercising their wits by asking each other
riddles or conundrums. Some of their fireside
riddles are preserved in a little book called
“Demands Joyous”—in modern English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">{230}</span>
Merry Questions—which was printed by
Wynkyn de Worde in 1511.</p>

<p>The following are a few of the conundrums
contained in this work, and at some of them
the reader, who is well acquainted with the
conundrums of the present day, will be
tempted to exclaim with Solomon, that there is
nothing new under the sun.</p>

<p>“What is it that never freezeth?—Boiling
water.</p>

<p>“What is it that never was and never will
be?—A mouse’s nest in a cat’s ear.</p>

<p>“How many straws go to a goose’s nest?—Not
one, for straws, not having feet, cannot
go anywhere.</p>

<p>“How many calves’ tails would it take to
reach from the earth to the sky?—No more
than one, if it be long enough.</p>

<p>“What man getteth his living backwards?—A
ropemaker.</p>

<p>“Why doth a dog turn round three times
before he lieth down?—Because he knoweth
not his bed’s head from the foot thereof.</p>

<p>“Why do men make an oven in a town?
Because they cannot make a town in an oven.</p>

<p>“How may a man discern a cow in a flock
of sheep?—By his eyesight.</p>

<p>“What is the worst bestowed charity that
one can give?—Alms to a blind man; for he
would be glad to see the person hanged that
gave it to him.”</p>

<p>An industry of considerable interest from a
domestic point of view came to the front in
1542; this was the manufacture of pins.
These useful articles were originally made
abroad, but the English pinners took to
making them, and on their engaging to keep
the public well supplied at reasonable prices,
an Act of Parliament was passed in the year
just named, forbidding the sale of any sort of
pins excepting “only such as shall be double-headed,
and have the heads soldered fast to
the shank of the pin, well smoothed, the
shank well shaven, the point well and round
filed, canted and sharped.”</p>

<p>The English pinmakers, however, either
proved unable or unwilling to keep their part
of the bargain, and complaints were so loudly
made that the pins were not what they should
be, that in 1545 the Act was declared
“frustrate and annihilated, and to be repealed
for ever.” Pins of good quality were of brass,
but unscrupulous makers made pins of iron
wire, blanched, and passed them off as brass
ones.</p>

<p>People who went from home then had no
choice—they must either ride or walk. Kings,
queens, and gentlefolk all mounted to the
saddle, the ladies being accustomed to ride on
pillions fixed on the horse, and generally
behind some relative or serving-man. Rude
carriages, however, made their appearance in
England in 1555.</p>

<p>Before the Reformation there were no poor’s
rates. The poor had their wants supplied by
charitable doles given at religious houses, and
by contributions placed in the poor man’s
box which stood in every church. In all
parishes there was a church house supplied
with dishes and cooking utensils. “Here,”
says John Aubrey, “the housekeepers met,
and were merry and gave their charity.”</p>

<p>Begging, under certain conditions, was regulated
by an Act of Parliament passed in
1530. By this Act justices of the peace were
required to give licences under their seals to
such poor, aged, and impotent persons to beg
within a certain precinct as they thought had
most need. If anyone begged out of the
district assigned to him he was to be set in
the stocks two days and two nights; and if
anyone begged without first obtaining a
licence he was to be put in the stocks
three days and three nights, and be fed with
bread and water only.</p>

<p>Vagrants were very sternly dealt with; but
in this Act, and in subsequent legislation on
the same subject, we see that our sixteenth-century
forefathers had an honest desire to do
their duty in relieving such as were in “unfeigned
misery.” In an Act passed in the
first year of Edward VI.’s reign we find the
curate of every parish required, “on every
Sunday and holiday, after reading the Gospel of
the day, to make (according to such talent as
God hath given him) a godly and brief exhortation
to his parishioners, moving and
exciting them to remember the poor people,
and the duty of Christian charity in relieving
of them which be their brethren in Christ,
born in the same parish and needing their
help.”</p>

<p>One of the interesting households of the
period was that of Sir Thomas More, the
famous Lord Chancellor who was executed in
1535. More lived at Chelsea, and of his happy
home there Erasmus, who knew him well, has
given the following charming account:—“More,”
he says, “has built, near London,
upon the Thames, a modest yet commodious
mansion. There he lives, surrounded by his
numerous family, including his wife, his son,
and his son’s wife, his three daughters and
their husbands, with eleven grandchildren.
There is not any man living so affectionate to
his children as he, and he loveth his old wife
as if she were a girl of fifteen. Such is the
excellence of his disposition, that whatsoever
happeneth that could not be helped, he is
as cheerful and as well pleased as though the
best thing possible had been done.</p>

<p>“In More’s house you would say that
Plato’s Academy was revived again, only
whereas in the Academy the discussion turned
upon geometry and the power of numbers,
the house at Chelsea is a veritable school of
Christian religion. In it is none, man or
woman, but readeth or studieth the liberal
arts; yet is their chief care of piety. There
is never any seen idle. The head of the house
governs it, not by a lofty carriage and oft rebukes,
but by gentleness and amiable manners.
Every member is busy in his place,
performing his duty with alacrity; nor is sober
mirth wanting.”</p>

<p>Speaking of More’s home life in his “Short
History of the English People,” Mr. J. R.
Green says:—“The reserve which the age
exacted from parents was thrown to the winds
in More’s intercourse with his children. He
loved teaching them, and lured them to their
deeper studies by the coins and curiosities he
had gathered in his cabinet. He was as fond
of their pets and their games as the children
themselves, and would take grave scholars and
statesmen into the garden to see his girls’
rabbit-hutches or to watch the gambols of
their favourite monkey.”</p>

<div class="ddropcapbox illowe10_9375" id="i_230">
  <img class="w100 idropcap" src="images/i_230.jpg" alt="W" />
</div><p><span class="uppercase">hen</span> Jack was gone,
Mrs. Shelley insisted
on Fairy’s
going to bed, for
the child was
worn out with
fatigue and excitement,
and she
and John watched
by Charlie’s couch
in turns through the short summer
night, which, short as it was, seemed
all too long when spent in anxiously
watching for a change which did not
come. Once, and once only during the
night, did Charlie open his eyes and
murmur, “Where am I?” but before
the shepherd, who was sitting by him,
had time to answer, he had again
relapsed into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>From the first John Shelley had taken
a hopeful view, and even this momentary
return to consciousness filled him with
hope; the next interval might be longer
perhaps; at any rate, it was a favourable
sign in the shepherd’s opinion. At four
o’clock Mrs. Shelley came to take her
husband’s place, and then, to her surprise,
he told her he was going to walk
to the nearest point where the London
coach passed and give Jack the latest
bulletin before he started.</p>

<p>And so, to Jack’s joy and amazement,
the first time the coach paused to take
up the Lewes letters, there stood his
father by the inn door, waiting to speak
to him. In a moment Jack, who, with
Mr. Leslie, was occupying the boxseat,
was down on the ground grasping his
father’s hand and eagerly asking what
news.</p>

<p>“No worse, Jack; if anything, a
trifle better; he was conscious for a
few moments last night; just opened his
eyes and said ‘Where am I?’ but I
knew you would like to hear the latest
news, as you can’t have a letter till you
get to New York, and I don’t know how
long that will be after you arrive there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll let you know all about the
mails, shepherd, when I come back.
Come, Jack,” called out Mr. Leslie,
from the box.</p>

<p>“God bless you, my boy, and grant
we may meet again someday,” said the
shepherd, wringing Jack’s hand, and
then the lad, with tears in his eyes,
jumped back to his place, the coachman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">{231}</span>
cracked his whip, and in a few minutes
nothing remained but a cloud of dust,
through which John Shelley was straining
his eyes to catch a last glimpse of
his eldest son.</p>

<p>The next day or two were passed in
such a whirl of excitement, what with
the exhilarating feeling of travelling on
the top of a coach for the first time in
his life, and being whirled up to London
by four horses in a few hours, and then
the wonderful things which, even in his
brief visit, he saw there, and then the
long journey to Liverpool, and the sight
of the docks and the ship he was to sail
in, for in those early days of the nineteenth
century no steamer had as yet
crossed the Atlantic. All this so occupied
Jack’s time and thoughts that
though that vision of Charlie stretched
pale and insensible at home haunted
him from time to time, still he had no
leisure to dwell on it. But when on
Monday Mr. Leslie, having seen him
on board, took leave of him, and Jack
was left alone among a crowd of strangers,
with nothing to do for five or six
weeks but watch the sea and sky, then
the thought of Charlie would not be
banished, and his anxiety to know how
he was became intense. Luckily Jack
turned out at first a bad sailor, and the
physical tortures of sea-sickness counteracted
the mental suffering he was
enduring, which, with so little to divert
his mind, might have ended in an attack
of brain fever. When he was well
enough to leave his berth, he made
friends with the captain and one or two
of the passengers, who took a fancy to
this fine, good-looking young man, who
certainly looked exceedingly unlike a
shepherd in the suit Mr. Leslie had
bought him at a London tailor’s. His
new friends lent him books, and he derived
both pleasure and benefit from
conversing with them, but yet, though
he read and studied hard during the
voyage, it was a terrible time to him,
and no landsman ever rejoiced more at
the sight of land than Jack did when
they sighted the American coast. He
always looked back on that voyage as
a dreadful nightmare, for all through
he had been haunted by the terrible
fear, almost too terrible to put into
words, lest he should be guilty of the
sin of Cain.</p>

<p>His first act on landing was to inquire
when he could have a letter from England,
and finding three weeks hence
was the earliest time he could hope to
receive one, for the ship he had come
by had just brought a mail, he made up
his mind to dismiss the subject as much
as possible, and wait as patiently as he
could for the letter which would colour
his whole life.</p>

<p>His new occupation, upon which he
entered at once, was far more congenial
than sheep-washing or shearing, and
the entirely new life he led and the new
country he was living in, with its strange
customs and foreign people, all helped
to give a fresh stimulus to Jack’s mind,
and if it had not been for the shadow
cast over his life by the memory of the
events which had been the immediate
cause of his coming hither, his first few
weeks in New York would have ranked
among some of the happiest in his life.
As it was, they slipped by far more
quickly than he had thought possible,
and at last he heard the news that the
English mail had arrived, and he bent
his steps to the post-office to ask if there
were any letters for him.</p>

<p>How Jack’s heart thumped as he
stood watching the clerk diving into
some pigeon-holes in search of his
letters; he fancied the people in the
office must have heard its wild beatings.</p>

<p>Yes, there were two letters; the first
Jack saw at a glance was from Mr.
Leslie, the other was directed by Fairy.
The paper on which the letter was
written—there were no envelopes in
those days—was not black-edged, and
that, though he dare not lay much stress
upon it, was, perhaps, a hopeful sign,
but yet, as he broke the wafer, he was
still in such fear and trembling lest its
contents should be unfavourable, that
he dared not open it until he was safe
in his own lodgings, where no curious
eyes could watch his behaviour as he
read his fate.</p>

<p>It was indeed well no curious eyes
were able to pry into Jack’s humble
room, his castle as he liked to call it,
for, poor as it was, it was his own, paid
for out of his earnings, for when he came
to the end of the long crossed sheet he
buried his face in his hands, and his
great strong frame shook with his sobs.</p>

<p>The letter, though directed by Fairy,
was from Mrs. Shelley, and ran as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dearest Jack</span>,—Thank God,
I have good news for you. Charlie is
quite well again, and is following the
sheep to-day for the first time, or he
would have written to you himself, but
since he went off this morning, Mr.
Leslie has been to tell me this letter
must be posted to-day.</p>

<p>“It is a month since you went away;
it seems years to me, Jack, but if you
are happy in your new life I shall not
complain. Charlie began to get better
very soon after you started; he recovered
consciousness that very morning, and
though he was very ill for a week or
more, he was not in danger after the
Sunday. How I wished I could have
let you know, but there was no means
of getting a letter to you before this one,
and I am afraid you must have suffered
terribly from suspense, fearing the worst,
and not daring to hope for good news.
Strange to say, Charlie remembers
nothing whatever about his accident;
all he knows is he wanted Fairy to dance
with him, and that you were angry; all
the rest is a blank; he had not the least
idea of what really happened.</p>

<p>“Your father had to get an under-shepherd
for a month, but he has left
to-day, and Charlie is to take your place,
and is very proud of his position. No
one will ever take your place at home,
though, so if you hear people say no
one is missed in this world, their place
is soon filled up, don’t believe it, my
son; your place in your mother’s heart
will never be filled except by yourself,
and I miss you at every turn. Fairy
misses you too; she is more at the rectory
now than ever, for there is no one
to help her with her lessons here. She
sends her love to you, and will write
next month. And now, my boy, I must
say good-bye, for your father has come
in on purpose to add a few lines to this.
God ever bless and keep you is the constant
prayer of your loving mother,</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">Polly Shelley</span>.”
</p>
</div>

<p>And then followed a few lines in the
shepherd’s handwriting, written with
elaborate pains and much effort, as Jack
knew, for John Shelley was much more
accustomed to wield his crook than his
pen, which was certainly not that of a
ready writer. His preparations were as
elaborate as the writing itself. First he
rolled up the sleeves of his smock; then
he ran his hands through his hair, and
rubbed the back of his head; then he
wetted his fingers; finally he fixed the
pen in his right hand, after a fashion of
his own; and Jack, as he read the postscript
of his mother’s letter, pictured to
himself his father’s attitude as he wrote
it, leaning half across the kitchen table,
and moving his whole body, as if every
stroke was the greatest exertion, as it
was to him. But if the manner of his
writing was eccentric, the matter was
excellent, in spite of the spelling, which
was original, and Jack treasured up his
father’s words carefully, and vowed never
to forget how gently and kindly the
shepherd had dealt with him in his
trouble.</p>

<p>So the tears Jack shed over his letter
were tears of joy and gratitude.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the Monday afternoon, while No. 1 was resting, the elder bachelor
sallied out by himself to see one or two of the important old churches.
By the aid of a map of the town, he found his way to the dirty old
church of St. Maurizio, where he saw some strangely beautiful paintings
of Aurelio and Bernardino Luini. He greatly wondered if the
abject poor, at their silent devotions—for there was no service at the
time—were as greatly influenced by art as were their predecessors in
the less enlightened days. But without wasting his time further in
worthless dreamings, which could better be done at another time, he
passed out of the stuffy and ugly little church into the glorious sunlight,
and proceeded to the more famous church of Santa
Maria della Grazie, to see the most popular picture
ever painted—namely, “The Last Supper,” by Leonardo
da Vinci.</p>

<p>The church was entered first; and here again were
groups of the poorest at their private devotions. Rapture
sublime seemed now and then to illumine the face of a dirty
beggar as he or she glanced at a crucifix or a relic which was
exposed to view over the altar of the Lady Chapel. Could such
worship be wrong if it softened, and so greatly softened, hearts
like these, in bodies ill-fed and ill-clothed, making a repulsive exterior
glorified by a countenance of secret joy? But disappointment came
by means of a surly sacristan, a veritable Judas with a bag, who
roughly attended the worshippers, and pocketed pence in return for
wiping their pocket handkerchiefs (for such we perforce call their
dirty rags) on the glass case on the altar containing the relic before
mentioned. To see the emotion of the deluded creatures, who
kissed their rags with ecstatic bliss on receiving them again,
was a strange sight, and struck us as widely different from that of
the woman who kissed the blue fringe on Christ’s garment as He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">{234}</span>
passed her—for what “virtue” could come
out of the operation in the Church of Santa
Maria della Grazie? The act of devotion and
lowly love in the Gospel story was not done
from force of habit, nor was the privilege
given in return for money—and, oh! how different
the Object and the intention!</p>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center">THE LAST SUPPER.</p>

<p class="center"><i>From the painting at Milan, showing its present condition.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The greatest painting in the world (“The
Last Supper”) is to be seen in an old outhouse
which was used by the reverend monks
as a refectory before the dissolution of the
monastery, and which has since been used as
a stable by French dragoons.</p>

<p>The painting is in a sad state of dilapidation,
caused by damp and attempted restorations
in 1770, and also by the bad treatment
it has had at the hands of tourists. But much
of the genius of the painting is still seen, and
we bow in lowly reverence before a work
which surely has been productive of much
religious elevation in many generations and
nations.</p>

<p>The Dominicans, in dining in this old refectory,
must have been wonderfully impressed
at seeing Christ at the other end of the room
taking His Last Supper with them; for the
accessories of table-cloth, glasses, etc., in the
painting resemble the identical articles used by
the monks, and all helped the great illusion.
But again a disillusion! for, as will be seen
on a reference to the picture, the reverend
fathers committed the sacrilege of forming a
doorway in a part of the picture—actually
cutting off the legs of the chief Figure—in
their desire to have their dinner warm!</p>

<p>The illness of the younger bachelor, which had
threatened to ruin our holiday, was not nearly
so serious as the doctor had led us to expect.
On the second day the fever much abated, and
we determined to resume our journey after the
third day. The doctor, however, advised us
not to go to either Cremona or Mantua, as
these cities, especially the former, are unhealthy,
and might bring on a renewal of the
fever. This was a disappointment, as we
were anxious to see Cremona, which, apart
from its cathedral and other buildings, has
always been renowned for the manufacture of
violins and other stringed instruments. To see
fiddles of every shape and size hung out in the
open air to dry like so many clothes after
washing, was too novel a sight to miss without
a bitter pang.</p>

<p>We determined to make up for our disappointment
in not seeing Cremona and
Mantua, by visiting the town of Pavia and
the magnificent monastery or Certosa close
to it.</p>

<p>So we arranged to make the excursion to
the Certosa and Pavia, to return to Milan for
a visit to the Brera Gallery, to dine, and to get
our trunks, and finally depart for Verona, if
possible, on the same day. This was rather
an extensive programme, especially as one of
us had just recovered from an illness; but we
determined if possible to abide by it.</p>

<p>The great Lombard plain is relieved from
monotony by being cut-up with canals and
ditches, running between avenues of willows
and poplars, reminding one of the scenery in
Dutch pictures.</p>

<p>Of course the Certosa is in many respects
an exquisite building. The magnificence of
the materials of its altars, screens, pavements,
&amp;c., and the enormous wealth of sculpture
lavished over every portion of it, render this
church one of the most remarkable structures
in the world. But when one comes to study
it and to think it well over, the question arises
whether this immense amount of costly
material, this vast amount of labour and skill,
ought not to have produced something far
more “striking” in general effect. In fact,
it rather reminds one of the so-called French
dinners, which English people are in the
habit of giving, from which one comes away
thoroughly unsatisfied, with only a confused
recollection of a great number of costly dishes.
It almost appears as if in the Certosa the
sculptors had been set to do the architecture
and the painters to execute the sculpture;
each has so attempted to overdo and over-elaborate
his portion of the work that he has
“strained” his art, until it has lost those
wholesome restrictions which the æsthetic
principles, both of classic and mediæval times,
had placed upon it. Thus we find the architectural
outlines broken up and lost in a forest
of detail, and the sculptured panels have
elaborated backgrounds more suited for pictorial
works than for carving.</p>

<p>The façade, which our girls perfectly know
by photograph, was designed by Borgognone,
far better known as a painter, and was commenced
about 1473.</p>

<p>One really sees nothing of the church until
entering the large gate, covered on the outside
with damaged frescoes; the wonderful
façade presents itself on the other side of the
quadrangle.</p>

<p>As can well be imagined, the first sight of
this wonderful front nearly took our breath
away, so vast is the amount of sculpture and
so elaborate the designs. The upper portion
is far less elaborate than the lower; indeed,
we thought that they were by different architects.</p>

<p>The most richly decorated portion of the
façade is that on the level of the portico, the
two windows on either side of the latter being
completely enclosed by a vast amount of
sculpturesque ornament. This elaboration is
carried out to such an extent that the mullions
of the windows, instead of being simply
moulded, are carved into imitations of candelabra,
with foliage, lizards, and little cupids in
the act of climbing, and ornamenting every
portion.</p>

<p>The subjects which pleased us the most
were the pictures of sculpture, a little above
the level of a man’s head, representing scenes
in religious history. These are very beautiful
and perfect, though some of the heads and
attitudes of the figures are, to say the least,
grotesque.</p>

<p>We may mention that a great number of
the most eminent Italian masters for nearly
two centuries had a hand in the elaboration of
the façade, including the great Donatello.</p>

<p>Before entering the church, we visited the
two cloisters, which are very picturesque. The
arches of the first one are full of terra-cotta
ornamentation. It is approached from the
church by a magnificent white marble doorway.</p>

<p>The great cloister is very large, and is surrounded
by cells, which remind one that the
Certosa was once a monastery, and belonged
to the Carthusians. This curious order of
men never see one another, except in church.
Each man has four rooms and a little garden
entirely to himself. He has his bedroom, his
study, his workshop, and his toolroom. These
Carthusians were extremely fond of gardening,
and we have received many benefits from their
knowledge of horticulture. They also invented
the well-known liqueur, Chartreuse.
Hence their name. This was invented as a
medicine, and is most wholesome and beneficial
for certain illnesses; but it is now, of
course, more used for its gastronomic than
its medicinal qualities.</p>

<p>The church was commenced in the latter
part of the fourteenth century; it is in form a
Latin cross, and in style a mixture of Romanesque
and Gothic. The whole of the interior
is very richly decorated, all kinds of material
being used, and the altars are beautifully inlaid
and studded with precious stones, gold,
etc. There are, however, scarcely any fine
pictures, the few good ones having been removed,
and the great number remaining
scarcely add to the beauty of the interior.</p>

<p>There are seven chapels on either side of
the nave, which are railed off from the latter.
These were shown to us by a guide, not by
a monk, as the guide-books say.</p>

<p>The Certosa is magnificently kept, and in
order to make it even more “smart,” the old
pavement has been replaced by a very bright
mosaic one, which reflects the church like
glass. But of all, the choir is the most magnificent,
the tabernacle and altar-screen being
sumptuous sixteenth century Renaissance
work, and on either side of the altar the walls
are decorated with rich sculpture.</p>

<p>In the transepts are two monuments, viz.,
those of Gian-Galeazzo Visconti, the founder
of the church, and of Ludovico Moro and his
wife, Beatrice d’Este.</p>

<p>Gian-Galeazzo Visconti was the most celebrated
of the great Lombard family of Visconti,
who practically ruled Milan for over a
century and a half. So great was the power
of this family, that they at times subjected
nearly the whole of Northern Italy, and Gian-Galeazzo,
after completely defeating an army
sent against him by the Emperor of Germany,
and after having captured by degrees the
whole of Lombardy, was about to declare
himself King of Italy, when death put an end
to his ambition in the year 1402.</p>

<p>Gian-Galeazzo Visconti was the founder of
Milan Cathedral and the Certosa of Pavia,
and, as before mentioned, a superb monument
has been erected to his memory in the latter
church; but this monument was more than
half a century in construction, by which time
the people had forgotten where the prince had
been buried; and thus the body of this great
man, who had defeated numberless armies and
caused to be erected two of the most sumptuous
buildings in Europe, lies no one knows
where.</p>

<p>The son of Gian-Galeazzo ruled in Milan
upon his father’s death, after which the Sforza
family succeeded, and held power until the
middle of the sixteenth century, when the
emperor, Charles V., who was practical master
of Italy, handed over the duchy of Milan to
his son Philip.</p>

<p>After leaving the Certosa, the two bachelors
hired one of the light one-horse carriages, of
which there are always a number outside the
church, and drove to Pavia. That drive was
most pleasant. It was a lovely spring day,
with a brilliant sun, though not too hot,
and the country was all aglow with bright
colour.</p>

<p>Pavia is a very curious old place. Of all the
old garlic-smelling, dirty, and badly-drained
cities of North Italy, it is the most garlic-smelling,
the dirtiest, and the worst drained;
but it is very quaint withal. The old marketplaces,
the projecting roofs, and the curious
outdoor shops give it a wonderfully “old-world”
appearance, and we enjoyed this
ramble through the old city greatly, notwithstanding
the horrible smells and the difficulty
we had to find our way about the place.
After wandering for some little time, we came
to the Piazza del Duomo, which is most
picturesque, and the effect was much enhanced
when we were there, as it was market time.
The vast quantity of old women, dressed in
the most quaint manner, selling the oddest of
wares, added no little to a scene which
must always be paintable to a degree. The
cathedral, rising on one side of the piazza,
with its huge campanile, though picturesque,
can scarcely be called beautiful. It has never
been finished, and when we were there it was
in a terrible state of dilapidation. Of the
interior we could see nothing except a heap of
scaffold-poles, as it was in course of restoration,
and even the shrine of the great St.
Augustine was concealed from view.</p>

<p>The most interesting church in Pavia is San
Michele, and, though we were rather pressed
for time, we determined to see it.</p>

<p>San Michele is an early Romanesque church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">{235}</span>
of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and is
very beautiful, both externally and internally.
The façade is richly ornamented with bands
of carving and small open galleries, and the
chancel internally is on a much higher level
than the nave, and is approached by a great
flight of steps, giving it a most dignified
appearance.</p>

<p>After leaving San Michele we tried to find
our way to the station; no easy matter, as we
found to our cost. We think we must have
made the circumference of the city three
times before an Italian boy, rather more intelligent
than his fellows, at last pointed us
out a place which proved to be the station,
from whence we returned to Milan.</p>

<p>The Brera Gallery contains a magnificent
collection of pictures. In an article like this
it is impossible to give a detailed description
of these paintings, and a mere list of works of
art is both uninteresting and uninstructive;
besides which no description of pictures is of
any value unless it is prefaced by an account
of the various schools to which the artists
belong—a task which has been admirably
done already by Miss Emily Macirone in the
pages of this magazine. However, we may
mention that the gallery is a complete history
of Italian art.</p>

<p>To commence with, we find a good example
of Giotto, who (as our girls will see from
the excellent chart of the chief painters of
the various schools of art, page 629 of
our Annual for 1886) flourished in the
commencement of the fourteenth century.
As on a future occasion we shall have to speak
of this painter, when describing the Arena
Chapel at Padua, all we shall say at present is
that one should not attempt to criticise him
or the works of this early Italian school by
mere isolated pictures found in galleries. Of
course in the days of Giotto Italian art was
more or less in its infancy, and the mechanical
knowledge possessed by these fourteenth
century painters was meagre, therefore we
must not expect to find grand effects of
chiaroscuro, neither is the rich colour of the
later school to be discovered.</p>

<p>Of the more perfected early Italian school
we find works by Luca Signorelli, Giovanni
Bellini, whom we shall find far better
represented in Venice, and the excellent
Francia, whose lovely picture of “Mater
Dolorosa” in our National Gallery is so well
known to our girls. We find, also, works of
Raffaelle, Leonardo da Vinci and his pupil,
Luini. But the best represented painters in
the Brera are the later Venetian school,
especially Titian, Tintoretto, and Paul
Veronese. The great glory of the collection
is Raffaelle’s picture of the marriage of the
Virgin. The arrangement of this picture at
first struck us as being extremely formal. We
find in the background a twelve-sided temple
crowned with a dome, standing directly in the
middle of the picture. The architecture of
this temple has been severely criticised; but
it by no means follows that because Raffaelle
thought the structure suitable for his picture
he would ever have built anything like it. In
front of the temple is a very formal pavement
divided into large squares. All the figures
are grouped together immediately in the foreground.
The High Priest stands in the centre,
holding the hands of Mary and Joseph. Behind
Joseph are many youths, and behind Mary are
a number of women—five in each group, thus
keeping up the symmetrical arrangement which
runs throughout the whole picture. There is a
charming grace about the head of Mary and
the two women standing immediately behind
her. May we call them the bridesmaids?</p>

<p>Joseph and the youths who accompany
him are represented with rods, but it will be
noticed that Joseph’s rod is crowned with five
blossoms, probably of the almond. Several
explanations have been given of this. The
most poetical supposes it refers to an ancient
legend that Mary had several suitors, as
would be almost certain to be the case of a
maiden of the house of David, possessed,
moreover, of great personal beauty. The
legend records that the various suitors each
cut a rod, which they laid in the temple, and
that after a time Joseph’s rod was discovered
to have blossomed. Some writers suppose that
the youths breaking the rods refer to an
ancient custom practised in Jewish marriages.</p>

<p>The picture is extremely beautiful in colour,
brilliant and well preserved. We venture to
suggest that the very symmetrical and formal
arrangement of the picture may have resulted
from its having been intended as the centre
portion of a group of compositions.</p>

<p>Titian is best represented by the frequently
engraved picture of St. Jerome—a work full
of grand power and magnificent chiaroscuro.
Leonardo da Vinci’s work in the gallery is one
of very great interest, as it is a study for the
head of the Saviour for his mighty work of the
Last Supper.</p>

<p>As the evening approaches, we dine at one
of the perfect <i>ristoranti</i> of Milan and proceed
by rail to Verona. On our way we were
captivated by the charming manners of the
peasantry; for we travelled third class, and
thus had a capital opportunity of judging. It
was a <i>fête</i> day at some of the towns our
train called at, and there were fireworks,
and every evidence of village festivity. But
although there was great demand for
seats in the train, we saw nothing of drunkenness
nor heard coarse language, or anything
resembling a vulgar cockney crowd—or,
for the matter of that, the vulgar, well-dressed
competitors for best seats who visit such
civilising entertainments as the Monday or
Saturday Popular and other London concerts!
No, the Italian peasantry could teach wonderful
lessons in kindness and self-respect to their
betters of England! We reached Verona at
midnight, and put up at a delightfully old
world hotel and slept the sleep of—well, the
tired, until the sun next morning reminded us
of another happy day in store for us.</p>

<p>And now there arises before us a scene
which will never be absent from the recollection
of either bachelor. A broad and rapidly-flowing
river, spanned by a lofty bridge,
pierced by a great circle between the centremost
arches, like the eye of some vast Cyclops.
Banks covered with ancient tiled-roofed houses,
above which rise an indescribable mass of domes,
towers, spires, pinnacles, and lofty walls,
crowned by forked battlements; the whole
backed up by undulating hills, clad with the
deep green of the cypress groves, amongst
which arise the round towers of a strange-looking
castle. Is this the recollection of
some picture we have seen, some place we
have dreamt of, or is it a reality?</p>

<p>The question seems further from being
solved as we wander through the streets and
squares of the poetical city. Every step brings
us in the presence of some wondrous recollection
of the past, and there is nothing to
fasten down our ideas to the present time.
Fresh dreams arise in every street. What is
this vast oval structure, with its countless
arches, reminding one of the great Colosseum
at Rome? Ruinous, it is true; but as we
enter it, strange to say, it seems to have
suddenly awakened from its dream of sixteen
centuries. Alas! it awakens us also, for
what do we see but in the centre of this great
arena the hanky-panky tricks of modern
horsemanship and hear the stale jokes of a
modern English clown! Let us, however,
leave this singular scene of anachronism and
again wander and dream.</p>

<p>This time there rises before us a series of
lofty sculptured tombs, each crowned by a
spire, surmounted by the figure of a man on
horseback, separated from the roadway by
some delicate metal work, wrought by the
hand of a thirteenth-century blacksmith into
a bewildering combination of quatrefoils, and
supported by graceful marble columns, each
bearing the image of a saint or angel. To
complete the picture, the whole is backed up
by a venerable-looking church, with a low,
tile-covered steeple and roof, plain enough but
for a beautiful marble monument placed above
the doorway. It is difficult to imagine anything
more enchanting in the way of architecture
than this extraordinary cemetery, filling
up the centre of one of the small squares
of the city.</p>

<p>We wander on again, and find ourselves
in front of a noble Gothic church, with a
façade shaded by two mighty arches, one over
the other, and beneath the lowermost a richly-carved
doorway. We enter, and a superb
picture is presented to our view. A Gothic
church of exquisite proportion and rich detail,
gleaming with coloured decoration, to which
the softening touch of time has lent harmony
and mellow tints. A pavement of variegated
marble is beneath our feet. Two queer
little statues, supporting holy water basins,
attract our attention, and a voice seems to
whisper in our ear, “I Gobbi.” Need we say
that this is the Church of St. Anastasia in
Verona.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to give our girls
anything like a description of the very
interesting objects in this beautiful city, or
adequately to express the feelings with which
one wanders about its streets. It is said that
“Music hath charms to soothe the savage
breast,” and the man must indeed be a savage
who would not feel the same soothing influence
in looking at Verona.</p>

<p>Everything, from its sweet-sounding name,
seems to breathe poetry and music into the
mind.</p>

<p>One seems to exist in a realm of fancy, and
little imagination is required to people it again
with Montagues and Capulets.</p>

<p>How strange it is that our great poet should
have managed to have so thoroughly embodied
the ideas which Verona impresses upon the
mind in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, without having
seen the place! When one reads the play
who has seen Verona, it seems almost impossible
to believe that Shakespeare did not draw
his picture from the place itself.</p>

only a very small
part of the universe,
and that the
life of man upon
this globe is but
a very small part
of that eternity to
which he is heir, is
indicated by a
thousand circumstances
in the life of every day, and by none
more strikingly than by the failures, the disappointments,
the total eclipses which sweep
from our sight into the undiscovered country
many a soul resplendent in promise, leaving
no record of them but in the faithful memories
of the few who knew and loved them.</p>

<p>“He whom God loveth, dieth early,” said
the thoughtful heathen, and it must be confessed
that we are all disposed to hang garlands
on our tombstones and to make heroes
of our dead. Flaws of temper and other foibles
which marred the perfection of those who
were most familiar to us while they were
tossed to and fro on the billows of this
troublesome world, are forgotten for ever when
the lines of care and thought are smoothed
from the brow on which Death has laid his
finger.</p>

<p>No young soldier left the Crimea with
greater distinction or greater promise than
Michael Fenner, the son of a house which
traced back its ancestors to the reign of
Elizabeth, and to which honour and piety had
always been dearer than riches. He had
entered the army with the true chivalrous
desire to fight for the right, to help the weak,
and confound the tyrant, and, a Christian in
heart and soul, he had maintained the simplicity
and purity of his life alike in the battlefield,
in weary marches, and in seasons of
sickness and depression.</p>

<p>Self-denying, gracious, and cheery, he was
welcome as the sun in springtime, and many
a groan was stifled and many a muttered
curse was turned into a blessing at the sight
of his kindly blue eyes, at the sound of his
brotherly voice, so that no one grumbled
when he was gazetted captain in his eight and
twentieth year.</p>

<p>Captain Michael Fenner in active service,
and with the modest fortune which he had
inherited from his parents, thought it no
indiscretion to marry the lady of his love,
Margaret Echlin, the daughter of the Rector
of Oldborough, a village in Warwickshire,
which his family had lived in for many years,
and people called her a lucky woman; for
what distinction was impossible to a man who
had already done so much and done it so
well? Nor was the promise of happiness
altogether belied. Eight years of happy
wedded life followed the happy marriage; two
healthy children, Mark and Eveline, brightened
their home; and as those were years of peace,
Michael was seldom long absent from his
family.</p>

<p>The Fenners were not rich; but as they
neither of them desired riches, and both had
the happy knack of enjoying what they had
without pining for what they had not, they
took their lives as the gift of the Good Father,
and so all was good to them.</p>

<p>But there came a day of sore trial, of bitter
sorrow to Margaret, of trial and sorrow which
Michael could not share. It was a day of a
great review, and Michael and his regiment
were to take part in it. His children will
remember to their dying day the bright face
that kissed them, the gay plumes, the flash
of gold and steel, and all the brilliant show
that rode forth from the barrack yard.</p>

<p>Half an hour, and the accident had happened
which made them orphans and their
mother a widow. Captain Fenner was riding
a young horse unaccustomed to the London
streets; he had ridden it in the country for
some months, and being a perfect horseman,
mounted without apprehension, but, unhappily,
the nervous creature took fright, and,
after a wild rush of some two or three hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">{237}</span>
yards, flung his rider heavily on the
pavement. To the amazement and horror of
everyone he was taken up lifeless. Without a
word, without a look, he was gone for ever
from among men.</p>

<p>The event was too solemn to be mourned
in the ordinary way. Men gazed at each other
with white, awestruck faces, and spoke beneath
their breath, as he was borne back to
the home which he had just quitted in full
health and strength. How many weak-hearted,
weak-willed men, who lived for their own
pleasure, with scarce a consciousness of the
higher life, might have been taken and the
world not palpably the worse; but this strong-hearted,
strongwilled man, on the very threshold
of a noble career, lay slain by what seemed the
merest accident in the heart of his native
country, almost within sound of his children’s
voices. “Truly the Lord’s ways are not our
ways, and they are wonderful in our eyes.”</p>

<p>Margaret sat stunned in her sorrow. Deep
in her smitten heart lay the consciousness that
with him all was well; softly in the sleepless
night she whispered his name, softly her cold
hands lingered on the heads and hair of her
children; but her eyes were dry, her voice
dead within her, until her friends, in a mistaken
hope of helping her, consulted together
in her hearing about taking away the children.
Then the strong chill gave way, the blood
rushed into her pale cheeks, she stood up, and,
holding each child by the shoulder, she looked
into the faces of her amazed friends.</p>

<p>“Bear with me,” she said; and her voice
was dry and hard, but it became more natural
as she proceeded. “Bear with me for awhile;
I am weak, but I shall be strong in time.
These are Michael’s children; you must not
take them from me.” Then bending down to
her children she kissed them, praying them
also to be patient with her, and said they
would help each other, and, from that day
forward she was first in their thoughts, they
in hers. With patient care she devoted herself
to all the duties of that sad time, and
when Michael Fenner was laid to rest in the
country churchyard, where many of his forefathers
slept, she set herself to master all the
circumstances of her position, and to ascertain
the means at her disposal for her own maintenance
and the maintenance and education of
her children. Friends shook their heads and
pitied “those poor Fenners,” but there was
not one with whom Margaret would have
changed lots; for had she not the memory of
her love and the care of those little children
who were his as well as hers?</p>

<p>A careful consideration of her circumstances
convinced Mrs. Fenner that it would not be
desirable for her to inhabit the house at Oldborough,
for though it was a modest house
enough for a family to live in, she felt herself
unequal to manage the farm which belonged
to it, and she knew that her pension would not
enable her to keep it up comfortably, besides,
before long it would be necessary for Mark at
least to go to school, and the nearest town
was ten miles from Oldborough. So Oldborough
Lodge was let to an Indian family
who were in search of just such a home, and
the farm was retained by the farmer, who had
held it ever since Michael’s father had died,
some fifteen years before; while Mrs. Fenner
and her children moved to a pretty little
cottage, which was fortunately to let, near the
ancient city of Sunbridge, in the parish
adjacent to which her brother was rector,
because she was deeply attached to her
brother, and because both he and his wife were
of opinion that it would be a great advantage
to Mark to study with their son Gilbert, until
the boys should be old enough to go to school.</p>

<p>The Rev. James Echlin, Rector of Rosenhurst,
near Sunbridge, was one of those
amiable and accomplished men, to whom, in
their curate period, everything seems possible,
everything probable; and when it was announced
that Lady Elgitha Manners, aunt to
the young Earl of Seven Beeches, had determined
to bestow her inestimable self and all
the weight of her aristocratic connections upon
him, it was accepted as an event quite within
the range of the proprieties, and the favoured
few among his congregation to whom the
great news was first communicated, assured
each other that it was no wonder, and that
they should see him a bishop before many
years were over their heads. The Reverend
James, who, like his sister, was disposed to
think rather too humbly of himself, was
amazed at his own good fortune, and meekly
submitted himself to it; but his wise father
shook his head, and his mother, though rather
dazzled by the brilliancy of the connection, felt
that it would have been more comfortable if
James had married a woman more in their own
rank. Indeed, the man who marries a wife,
who condescends to his alliance, is seldom to
be envied, and, though James Echlin’s sweet
nature prevented his chafing under it, it was
by no means good for him or for his children
that the Lady Elgitha, in right of her superior
knowledge of the world, and of her family
connections, exercised the <i>summum imperium</i>
in all household arrangements.</p>

<p>Of their eight children only two, Gilbert
Manners, the eldest, and Elgitha Manners, the
youngest, lived past infancy. Gilbert was a
handsome boy, well grown and vigorous
enough, but Elgitha was long a frail, little
maid, who seemed likely to be added to the
row of tiny mounds under the chancel window,
which were all that remained to tell of the six
infant Manners Echlins who had spread their
wings and joined the innumerable throng of
infant angels.</p>

<p>Like most ruling ladies, the Lady Elgitha
had her favourite, and this favourite was—as
was but natural—her son: for had he not
paid her the initiatory compliment of inheriting
her aquiline features? and as he grew up
were not his tastes and feelings in charming
harmony with her own? While a child in the
nursery he eschewed fairy tales “as rubbish,”
and when he became a boy, and went to
school, learning as learning was a bore; and
he early adopted it as a maxim to give his
attention to nothing that “didn’t pay”—an
expression which charmed his mother by its
shrewdness, but strangely chilled his father,
who, in all his life, had never taken such a
consideration into account.</p>

<p>With a sense of the vital importance of modern
languages which is impressed on the brain
of our female aristocracy, Lady Elgitha had imported
to Sunbridge first a Parisian <i>bonne</i>, then
a German; and Gilbert, Mark, and Eveline had
the opportunity of acquiring a <i>patois</i> which
familiarised them with the names of ordinary
things, and, it may be, facilitated their subsequent
studies in both languages; but little
Elgitha was too delicate in the early years of
her life to be trusted either to <i>bonne</i> or
<i>fräulein</i>, and she was permitted to repose on
the ample bosom of a comfortable Englishwoman,
who was as sweet as a clover-field
and about as intelligent; and while she
nursed and tended the frail little body, had
not the remotest notion of in any way disturbing
the little brain, but was more than
satisfied to see repeated in his little daughter
the features and the sweetness of her father.</p>

<p>When Gilbert had attained his seventh
year, Lady Elgitha decreed that an erudite
curate should be sought out, who, in addition
to his clerical duties, should instruct both
boys in the mysteries of the Latin grammar,
and should prepare Gilbert for Eton, and
Mark for the local grammar school, which had
a very good reputation; and so, for three
years, the boys worked together under the
guidance of the Rev. Theophilus Wilkins,
who, having rather overtaxed his brain by
taking a “double first” at Oxford, was not
sorry to rest a little by going back to first
principles with the cousins, the elder of whom
was interesting as the grandson of an earl,
while the orphanage of the younger could
hardly fail to awaken his sympathy.</p>

<p>As was natural, Gilbert took the lead, and
was always the person most considered, but
Mark had an innate love of learning, which
made him accept with eagerness whatever was
offered to him. From the day when a six years’
child he spelt out the mysteries of “haec
musa” to that when he gave proof of accomplished
scholarship by carrying off the first
honours of his school, it never occurred to
Mark to clip his studies by a careful selection
of what would carry him through an examination,
too much engrossed by learning to
count personal profit or want of profit in the
matter; while Gilbert from his tenderest years
showed a precocious esteem for “what would
pay” and a profound unwillingness to learn
anything for its own sake; so that when he
was ten years old, it being found that Mark
was in all respects in advance of his cousin,
Lady Elgitha decreed that it was waste of
time for Mark to study at home any longer,
and that Gilbert had better be sent to one of
those feeders of Eton where the subjects of
study are strictly narrowed to suit the demands
of that seat of learning; and in due course
Gilbert Manners Echlin, having passed through
the congenial mill of the Rev. Edward Thornborough,
at Staines, took a good place on his
entrance, and was fairly launched into the sea
of public school life. His grandfather and his
uncle being earls, and his father a parson, he
was not particularly badgered on his first
coming; he was sufficiently aristocratic in
countenance and bearing to pass muster with
the boys, and sufficiently ready with his lessons
to escape the censure of masters.</p>

<p>Mark Fenner, meanwhile, diligently attended
the Grammar School at Sunbridge,
walking to and fro summer and winter, wet
and dry, and, with his bright, cheery face and
steady ways, won the love of masters and of
boys, and worked his way with quiet perseverance
to the top of the school. It never occurred
to him to envy Gilbert his fine clothes
or the guineas he jingled in his pockets when
he came to the cottage to say good-bye; and
he submitted with an easy grace to the airs of
patronage which his cousin assumed. It was
natural, he thought, that his Aunt Elgitha’s
son should go to Eton, and it was equally
natural and right that he himself should work
out his lessons without other aid than that of
dictionary and grammar by the light of his
mother’s lamp in the cottage parlour, occasionally
refreshing himself by a half-unconscious
glance at the enlarged photograph over
the mantelpiece, which was the only portrait
they had of their father, and which, dull and
poor as it was in comparison with the bright
presence which had passed away, was yet an
outward visible sign of it very dear to the
three who called the cottage home.</p>

<p>In countenance Mark was not at all like
his father, resembling his mother in feature
and complexion; but many a time and oft the
widow’s heart beat and tears rose in her eyes
as she recognised in her boy traits which assured
her of that higher affinity of heart and
mind which is infinitely deeper than any trick
of feature or complexion. It is a mistake to
suppose that because boys are often rough in
speech and careless in manner there is any
reason for it in their boyhood, and though
the braggart and the bully naturally attract
most attention, and do what they can to spoil
the beauty of the little republics in which they
live, we confidently believe that there are
hundreds of boys who have no taste for bullying
and coarse talking any more than for lying
and thieving, and who pass through their
school career pure in speech and gentle in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">{238}</span>
nature. Certainly Mark Fenner never need
have blushed if his mother had heard all he
said any more than if she had read the thoughts
of his heart; yet Mark was almost as good in
the cricket-field as in the school-room, he was
an adroit swimmer, a stout wrestler, and,
better than all, an excellent walker.</p>

<p>Eveline, who was just two years younger
than her brother, was a bright, healthy damsel,
not specially clever, but one of those girls
who have a truly feminine and harmonising
influence in families, modest and happy in
temper, always more occupied by care for
others than for herself. She had acquired
most of her knowledge from her mother, and
would have been pronounced by many a
young lady of the nineteenth century “frightfully
ignorant.” I am afraid it would have
cost her some thought to define what is
meant by physical, political, and commercial
geography; physiology as a science was unknown
to her, but she had been an apt pupil
in those graces which no board of examiners
can gauge, but without which English homes
would never have been the desire and the admiration
of foreigners, the safety and the
comfort of her sons.</p>

<p>Eveline was sufficiently well-read to take an
interest in wholesome books and understand
political questions, when they were discussed;
and for this she was much indebted to her
uncle, with whom she was a great favourite,
and whom she often accompanied on his parish
rambles, when he beguiled the way and relieved
his own heart by gently philosophising
after a fashion too ideal to find favour with
Lady Elgitha, but which sounded very sweetly
in the ears of the young Eveline.</p>

<p>And so the years sped on. Gilbert had left
Eton with fair credit, but without having
attained any distinction, and was making up
his mind what he should do next—a process
that occupied him some months, and which,
but for the pressure of circumstances, which
his mother regarded as cruel, he might never
have achieved; but she was well aware that
his father could not live for ever, that her
fortune would be too small to support him,
when divided, as by her father’s will it must
be, between her children. The church, the
army, the bar, which was it to be? The church
was perhaps the easiest; it would not cost
Gilbert much trouble to take a respectable
degree, and there was a good living in the
family; but the living was in Northamptonshire,
in a part of the country which Gilbert
knew and did not admire; besides, a country
life, even with all the amenities of Sunbridge
within easy reach, did not suit him. He would
have preferred the army if he could have been
guaranteed against heavy campaigning, and
if the examinations for the higher branches of
the service had not been so stiff. As to law, it
was horrid all round, absolutely nothing to be
got without burning the midnight oil, a process
to which, in its classic sense, Gilbert had a
special objection, though he testified no aversion
to midnight gas. So the months passed, until
the time came for Mark to leave school, which
he did after having been captain for a couple
of years, with a long row of charmingly-bound
prize books and a very good scholarship to
Trinity College, Cambridge.</p>

<p>Then Lady Elgitha, finding her son no
nearer to a conclusion, decreed that he also
should go to Cambridge; all her family who
were not in the army had gone to Cambridge;
but as Gilbert had not the gift of plodding, a
smaller college, his father’s, Corpus, was chosen
for him. Boys of his age seldom cared for the
church; he would probably come round in a
year or two, and then he would be in the right
road for it.</p>

<p>Mark was sure to do well. He had had
nothing to do at Sunbridge but work,
whereas poor Gilbert had been so distracted
at Eton by games, society, etc., etc. Mark
would distinguish himself. He could hardly
help doing so, and no doubt would be glad
of the opportunity to do his cousin a service
in return for the many benefits he and his
mother and sister had received from his
uncle.</p>

<p>The seven years which the boys had spent
apart, except during holidays, had widened
the natural gulf between them; and when
Mark, in obedience to his aunt’s wish, offered
to read with Gilbert, he found the task no
easy one. Gilbert professed an abomination
for mathematics, and by his ignorance of the
first principles, seemed to justify the opinion
generally entertained of the perfection in
which the study is ignored in the old schools.</p>

<p>“It’s just horrid, old man!” he exclaimed
one morning, after half-an-hour’s study,
thrusting his long fingers through his fair
hair. “I’m awfully sorry for you having to
grind away at it.”</p>

<p>“But I like it!” said Mark, mind and eyes
deep in his geometry. “Just listen, Gilbert.
I do think I see another solution.”</p>

<p>“Another solution!” cried Gilbert, in
despair. “Just as if one was not enough.”</p>

<p>“But it’s so interesting,” persisted Mark.
“If you’d only give your mind to it, I’m sure
you’d like it; it is so pretty.”</p>

<p>“Where’s the good? I’m not going in for
a don. I shall scrape through when the time
comes, never fear. Hullo! There’s St. Maur
and Tullietudlem in a tandem. Splendid,
isn’t it? How will Tullie ever get that wild
filly of his round the corner? There! I knew
it. Down goes the old woman—wagon,
Tullie, and St. Maur on the top of her.
There’ll be a row!”</p>

<p>“They’ll have something to pay, at all
events,” said Mark, looking up, but still deep
in his problem.</p>

<p>“Never a bit. A sovereign to the old
woman. She’s used to it. Nothing will ever
teach Tullie to handle the ribbons. Never
could at Eton; and his sister’s such a splendid
whip. I wonder where they were going to!
Newmarket, perhaps. St. Maur’s uncle is
running a two-year-old. O, bother, Mark!
I can’t be worried now. The very look of
those figures makes me sick! I shall get up
enough to scrape through, never fear. I’m
strong in classics.”</p>

<p>“All right, old fellow,” said Mark, shutting
up his book. “Then you won’t want me.
Tell me if you do, you know. I’ll come in
any day.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, a thousand times. It is no good
working against the grain, is it? My head is
all in a whirl with that stupid geometry.”</p>

<p>Internally wondering at the stupefying
effect of the geometry he had not done on
his cousin’s brain, but too happy to escape to
his own quiet room, Mark Fenner ran with
the speed of a lover across the familiar flags,
and buried himself until lunch time in his
favourite study.</p>

<p>At half-past one his friend, John Mildmay,
came in for lunch and for a chat; and the
lads ate their bread-and-butter and pressed
beef, flanked with a jug of college ale, with a
keen appetite and much pleasant talk about
men and things. The meal ended, they
started for their afternoon walk along the
banks of the Cam, interchanging many a
cheery greeting with friends on land and river,
invigorating mind and body by sufficient and
temperate exercise, and taking care to be back
in time for “chapel,” which they attended in
the loveliest of chapels—aëry and exquisite
King’s.</p>

<p>So to Mark Fenner Cambridge was what it
should be—a home of intellectual effort, of
happy and reposeful thought, sweetened by
the companionship of chosen friends, mostly
men of very moderate means like himself, to
whom the Alma Mater was holding out her
protecting arms. Some men of his cousin’s
set made overtures to him—men whose
fathers remembered his father; but Mark had
the courage to decline their invitations, and
to keep to the work he had set himself to do;
and when the term was ended, and the lads
went home, Mark’s cheeks were round and
rosy, while Gilbert looked so thin and pale
that his mother was alarmed lest he had been
doing too much.</p>

<p>“Very possibly, my dear,” said the rector,
to whom she imparted her fears, with his
sweet sad smile, “but not too much work;
Gilbert is innocent of that, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“I do not think you ever have understood
the poor boy, James. He is not a book-worm,
like Mark, of course, no Manners ever was; it
is unfortunate for him that he does take so
much after my family.”</p>

<p>“You are the best judge of that, Elgitha;
he certainly does not appear to me much to
resemble any of my people. Perhaps, as far
as this world is concerned, it is all the better
for him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know why you should say that,
James,” said Lady Elgitha, rather reproachfully;
“surely your lot has fallen in pleasant
places.”</p>

<p>“I did not mean to complain, my dear; my
fortune is much above my deserts. If I should
like to see Gilbert more studious, it is perhaps
from a selfish wish to have him more in
sympathy with myself—not that I am much of
a student, I am but an idle fellow, God help
me, enjoying my pleasant, easy life here with
you, Margaret, and the girls.”</p>

<p>“Everybody must be happy in his own
way,” said Lady Elgitha. “Gilbert would
never be happy as a parson; it is my belief
that he wants an active life. I must write
to the Earl about him—something in the
Treasury now.”</p>

<p>“My dear, your nephew cannot nominate
as your father and grandfather did. Gilbert
must stand the test of an examination; if he
cannot satisfy the examiners, no amount of
blue blood will avail him.”</p>

<p>“According to that, Mark will have the
best chance in the world.”</p>

<p>“And everywhere else,” said the rector.
“I only wish our Gilbert had half the chances
of Margaret’s fatherless boy. Michael Fenner,
though dead, has done more for his son than
I for mine. Gilbert is selfish, idle, almost
illiterate, and I look with shame on the
virtues of my nephew who has had so much
less done for him.”</p>

<p>“Why, Rector, what has given you such a
fit of the blues this afternoon?” exclaimed
Lady Elgitha, regarding him with amazed
alarm.</p>

<p>The rector attempted some jest, and calling
his little daughter, set out on his usual afternoon
peregrination, while Lady Elgitha,
seriously disturbed, reflected whether it would
be advisable to calm his troubled mind by a
course of globules, or to divert his thoughts
by a dinner party or a tennis tournament.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Yorkshire people of the West Riding,
according to Mrs. Gaskell, are “sleuth
hounds” after money, and in illustration of
this characteristic we may take the following
anecdote:—</p>

<p>Not far from Bradford an old couple lived
on their farm. The good man had been ill
for some time, when the practitioner who
attended him advised that a physician should
be summoned from Bradford for a consultation.</p>

<p>The doctor came, looked into the case, gave
his opinion, and, descending from the sick-room
to the kitchen, was there accosted by
the old woman with “Well, doctor, what is

<p>“My fee is a guinea.”</p>

<p>“A guinea, doctor! a guinea! And if you

<p>The old woman rose and went upstairs to

<p><span class="smcap">Die junge Maus.</span>—Although you have attained to
the patriarchal age of twenty-one, and your bones
have only just become hard, we see no objection to
your learning to paint. There are works on the
subject you name in French as well as English.
Write to the publisher, Mr. Tarn. Ours is the
editorial department.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emily Kaighin.</span>—A milking-stool is round in the
seat, about ten inches in diameter, and has three
wooden legs sloping outwards. People use it more
as a means for the practice of their artistic ideas
than as a restful appliance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May.</span>—To remove a photo from a dirty mount, cut
away all the margin of the latter and put it to float
in a plate of clean tepid water. Should it fail to
become detached, hold it with the back near the fire,
and you will then peel it off. Sometimes a solution
of indiarubber is used in mounting (improperly so,
we think), and this is the best plan to adopt in such
a case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Photo.</span>—The medium mentioned in “Photographine”
is sold with the apparatus for the art.</p>

<p>A. M. B.—To acquire the art of painting on glass or
china, you might be taken as an apprentice at
various firms, such as that of Mr. Cameron, 69,
Wigmore-street, Cavendish-square. W.; or the
Messrs. Powell, of the Whitefriars Glass Company,
Whitefriars-street, E.C. This company receives
ladies, who work in a separate room for six hours
daily, and four on Saturdays. The Messrs. Simpson
and Messrs. Mortlock likewise employ ladies. The
average earnings are from £60 to £70 per annum for
the lower branches of art, and as much as £100 for
the higher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bull Finch.</span>—We must refer you to the answer above
given to “A. M. B.” You will find plenty of designs
for tile and china painting in the volumes of the
G. O. P. You need not look further.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Would-be Professional.</span>—Certainly, a livelihood
could be made out of wood engraving, but then you
should have more than one qualification for it.
Practical skill, persevering industry, good sight, a
firm, steady, yet delicate touch, and natural artistic
taste. The work has the advantage of being home
work, and needs little outlay—a good set of tools,
and the boxwood blocks purchased as required. A
skilled engraver can earn from £3 upwards a week.
If you study at the South London Technical Art
School, 122 and 124, Kennington Park-road, you will
have £3 to pay per annum for fees, half-yearly and
in advance. When you have acquired the art,
illustrate some popular work or picture initial letters
for articles, and little end sketches for the same, and
take them to publishers as specimens. You might
obtain advice at the central office of the City and
Guilds of London Institute, Gresham College, London,
E.C. The director and secretary is Philip
Magnus, Esq.</p>

<h3>MISCELLANEOUS.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p><span class="smcap">Young Inquirer.</span>—1. Yes, there is such a thing as a
“singing flame,” and it is not like a singing kettle
nor a windy gaspipe, and is as great a wonder as the
fabulous “singing tree,” had that been real. A very
delicate jet of flame, introduced through a small pipe
into a narrow glass tube of a foot long, will respond
to the singing of any one note, if set in tune to it.
Professor Tyndall says, “With a little practice, one
is able to command a flame to sing and to stop singing,
while it strictly obeys the injunction. When the
proper pitch has been ascertained the experiment is
sure to succeed; and, from a distance of twenty or
thirty feet, the flame when sung to is caused to sing
responsively. If it do not respond, it is because it
has not been spoken to in the proper tone; but a note
of somewhat higher pitch causes it to stretch its
tongue and sing vigorously.” 2. The 1st of April,
1869, was a Thursday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith, Hope, and Charity.</span>—See “Practical Hints
About the Growth of the Hair,” in our part for
July, 1885. The name Thames is derived from the
Attic word <i>Tamh</i>, signifying “quiet,” the Saxon
<i>Temese</i>, the Latin <i>Tamesis</i>. Possibly the latter may
contain the origin of the name Isis, as given to the
river at Oxford.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eileen.</span>—Yes, Ireland was anciently called Insula
Sacra, so Festus Airenus affirmed; but it must be
noted that this author wrote in the fourth century,
and this was before St. Patrick established Christianity
there. Also, the name given to Ireland was
not exclusively a distinctive one, for the Isle of
Samothrace was also entitled the Sacred Isle.
Another name for Ireland was Muic Innis, or Isle
of Muc, Muc being the name applied to the divinity
as worshipped by them, and signified “sacred.”
Beautiful as much of the country is, any visitor would
be struck with the appropriate selection of the latter
name (according to its English sound and meaning)
after seeing the filthy surroundings and habits of the
natives, the pigs, poultry, and human kind wallowing
together within the same mud walls, and by
preference!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zearn.</span>—A butler has the care of the wine cellar, decants
the wine, and serves it at table. He places the
chief dish on the table, or carves it at the side table, and
his place is behind his master’s chair, while the footman
(if one) stands behind his mistress. The butler
also stands behind the footman when the latter opens
the hall door to visitors. The servant, improperly
called a butler, who holds a single-handed place
combines the duties of both butler and footman, with
the exception of the care of the wine cellar, unless
in exceptional cases of special trust.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Reader.</span>—The initials R.S.V.P. are those of the
French phrase <i>Répondez, s’il vous plaît</i>, “Answer,
if you please.” Painting in oils is much easier than
in water-colours, as mistakes can be rectified and improvements
made.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">English Churchman.</span>—The Orders as now existing
in the Established Church are derived from St.
Augustine of Canterbury. Although St. Joseph of
Arimathea brought the Christian faith to Britain in
the first century, the reception of it was very partial,
and the mission of St. Eleutherius in the second
century established a line of sixteen archbishops, the
last of whom, Theanus, was driven from his see into
Wales about 587. Here a Primitive church of Eastern
origin was already in existence, and when the second
Roman mission was sent over by Gregory, through
Augustine, and established Christianity in the south-eastern
part of Britain, the little mission church in
North Wales was still existing, and protested against
any usurpation of authority by the newly-planted
Church of Canterbury. At the same time we cannot
trace any Orders in the Established Church derived
from them, although we have historic evidence of a
primacy in the reign of King Arthur being removed
from Caerleon to Llandaff, and thence to St.
David’s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span>—We think if you belong to the Young

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Goudge.</span>—The phrase you give appears to be
made up of certain passages of Holy Writ. See
1st Tim. vi. 4, 5, 20, and 2nd Tim. ii. 23.</p>

<p>E. A. L.—We think you had better look out the word
“supernatural” in the dictionary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bishop.</span>—Canons are residentiary members of a
cathedral chapter, of which the dean is the chief.
The office was instituted in the eighth century,
and their duty is to act as the advisers of the bishop.
They do receive salaries, varying in amount. Archdeacons
take precedence of them. They act as the
representatives and delegates of the bishops, especially
in the duty of parochial visitation. Their office
dates from the fifth century. Their salary is very
trifling, supposed only to cover the cost of their
journeys. A prebendary has a right to a stall in
the choir of a cathedral church and vote in the
chapter, and to the receipt of certain revenues for
the performance of certain duties in that or a collegiate
church. The office was instituted in the eleventh
century, and may be held by a layman, although
such cases are rare, if actually existing. A rural dean
is a beneficed clergyman charged with the inspection
of a deanery, or sub-division of an archdeaconry,
under the supervision of his bishop. The original
duties of the office are for the most part practically
transferred to the archdeacon.</p>

<p>W. L.—The first voyage made all round the world
was by a Portuguese commander, who sailed from
San Lucas on September 20th, 1519, in the ship
<i>Vittoria</i>. The name of this pioneer navigator was
Ferdinand Magellan, giving the straits through
which he passed their name. He was killed on the
Philippine Islands the following year, and Sebastian
del Cano brought the ship round the Cape of Good
Hope, and arrived at San Lucas six days within the
three years’ expedition, September 6th, 1522. Five
ships formed the fleet; three lived to go through the
straits with Magellan and his crew; the <i>Vittoria</i> was
the only one that reached home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">An Italian Girl.</span>—The 30th April, 1866, was a
Monday. The letters <i>i.e.</i> represent the Latin words
<i>id est</i>, or, in English, “that is,” or, more freely
translated, “that means, in other words,” when an
explanation of the words employed is required. The
Jesuits were banished from Portugal in 1759, suppressed
in France 1764, in Spain 1767, and subsequently
in Naples, Parma, and Modena, and in 1773
Pope Clement XIV. issued a bull, concluding with
the words, “We do extirpate and abolish the Society
of Jesus.” In 1814 Pope Pius VII. re-established it.
A large number of Jesuit priests were executed at
the time you name on account of real or supposed
political intrigues. You write a beautiful hand, and
you have our best wishes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seeker of Light.</span>—Our blessed Lord’s atonement on
the Cross was of infinite efficacy, and our sins—even
the most heinous—are those of mere finite creatures.
Thus, “He is able to save to the uttermost.” The
term “scarlet,” as applied to sin, is a figure of
speech. It is not only glaring and conspicuous, but,
as produced in ancient times, it was exceedingly
durable. The Phœnicians were famous for it, and
the Tyrian purple and scarlet were produced from
two little shellfish, the <i>Buccinum</i> and <i>Murex</i>, only
found in perfection on the rocky coast of their
country. The dye when exposed to a bright light
became successively green, blue, red, and deep purple;
and, by washing it in soap and water, of a bright
and permanent crimson. Costly fabrics were twice
dyed, and made so beautiful and so very durable
that they brought fabulous prices. Thus, the allusion
made to a scarlet dye is explained. However deeply
dyed and stained with sin, the precious blood of
Christ can wash the sinner as white as snow. There
is no limit to its cleansing power.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. A. Gray.</span>—You would do well to advertise your
autographs and take what you can get for them from
the trade, or else dispose of them by arrangement
with private friends. The <i>Exchange and Mart</i>
would be a good advertising medium.</p>

play by <i>hear</i>, but by ear.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
